## Colors

In `PaperCSS`, we defined helpers colors names classes which we use in a lot of components, such as in the `PAlert`, `PButton`, `PBadge` and many other components. You can use them for text and background.

- `primary`: this is the default color, often associated to darker colors (dark/grey).
- `secondary`: this is a blue-ish color.
- `success`: the success color is associated to the green color.
- `warning`: warning is yellow/orange-ish.
- `danger`: danger is the critical-alert in red.
